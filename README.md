# Reinforcement Learning
## Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients

We present our implementation of an Reinforcement Learning Algorithm called DeepDGP, presented by [Lillicrap et
al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971).

### Usage Instruction

``` python
cd src
python train.py --env_id=<any openAI-gym continuous environments>
```

To run pretrained models
```
cd src python run.py --env_id=Pendulum-v0
```
